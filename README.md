# React Native Dimensions Bug: Inconsistent Screen Dimensions on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug related to inconsistent screen dimension retrieval using `Dimensions.get('window')` in React Native on Android. The issue manifests as incorrect height values, leading to layout problems.  The solution explores different approaches to obtain reliable screen dimensions.

## Bug Description

The `Dimensions.get('window')` API sometimes returns an inaccurate height on Android devices. This results in UI elements being cut off or the layout not fitting the screen correctly. The inconsistency makes debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android emulator or device.
3. Observe that the layout might not display correctly, with elements potentially being cut off at the bottom.

## Solution

The provided solution explores alternative methods to retrieve consistent screen dimensions.  This might involve using the `Dimensions.get('screen')` API, which sometimes offers more reliable results.  Another approach is to listen to layout events to ensure the dimensions are obtained after the layout process completes.
