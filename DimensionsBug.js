This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method might return incorrect values, particularly the height, resulting in layouts that don't fit the screen properly or elements being cut off. This is often intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.
